Officials in the experimental city of Aurora Heights unveiled a new artificial
intelligence traffic system Friday, claiming early results show significant
reductions in congestion and commute times.

The system, developed in partnership with university researchers and private
engineers, uses real-time camera feeds and sensor data to adjust traffic lights
dynamically throughout the city. Unlike traditional timed signals, the AI model
responds instantly to accidents, construction, and traffic surges.

City planners say a three-month pilot program reduced average commute times by
18% during peak hours. Emergency response vehicles also benefited, reaching
destinations faster as the system automatically cleared intersections.

“We wanted to see what would happen if traffic infrastructure could think
instead of just follow a schedule,” said project lead Dr. Elena Park. “The early
results are encouraging, but this is still a controlled experiment.”

Privacy advocates have raised concerns about data collection, though officials
say all video feeds are anonymized and processed locally without storing
identifiable information.

If the trial continues to show positive outcomes, Aurora Heights plans to expand
the system citywide next year. Other municipalities are already monitoring the
project closely, viewing it as a potential blueprint for future smart cities.
